Changes: The project is a decision support system rather than just a data visualization tool.

What we are building

We are building a custom data visualization off of the open sourced software, nullschool. Our visualization will compare real-time and forecasted data in two separate layers, in addition to having a third layer to show a direct comparison between the two. The data will is to be pulled from online sources, and eventually the data that will be provided by our sponsor at the Aerospace Corporation.

Why we are building it

We are building the custom decision support system for our sponsor since nothing currently exists in that area at this time. Our sponsor hopes to use it for military and governmental purposes in order to more quickly determine how realistic weather models are.
