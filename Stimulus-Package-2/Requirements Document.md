##INSTRUCTIONS##
The file should have three sections. The first section should be called “Assumptions.” The second should be called “Functional requirements.” The third should be called “Non-functional requirements.” The document should be no more than 1000 words. Write your “assumptions” section last. The document will be graded on how comprehensively and clearly it specifies what your system must do.

## Assumptions

## Functional requirements

+There should be three layers; the forecasted layer, actual layer, and comparison layer
+Each layer should pull information from an outside data source
+Users should be able to see the most recently available data
+Measures of the windspeed should be shown

## Non-functional requirements

+The cost of the software should be kept to a minimum
