#End Quarter Summary
1. where is our project right now?

Our project is currently forming itself to the final product. We can pull and display from data sources, as well as filter our what is not needed.
Our biggest challenge that has always been around is finding the right location to pull our weather data from. 

2. what are the main pending tasks we have now?

As previously mentioned, we need to find a solid place to pull data from. We can find model data just fine, but the actual data is what is giving us issues.
Documentation on how to set up our application on a new server.

3. what should we do to complete those tasks?

Keep having discussions with our sponsor on possible locations to pull the actual weather data from.
