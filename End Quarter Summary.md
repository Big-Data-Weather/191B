#End Quarter Summary
1. where is our project right now?

Our project is currently forming itself to the final product. We can pull and display from model data sources, as well as filter out what is not needed for the model data.
Our biggest challenge has always been around is finding the right location to pull our weather data from. 

2. what are the main pending tasks we have now?

As previously mentioned, we need to find a solid place to pull data from. We can find model data just fine, but the actual data is what is giving us issues.
Automate the generation and pulling of the data files.
Documentation on how to set up our application on a new server.
Setting up the application on Aerospace's servers.

3. what should we do to complete those tasks?

Keep having discussions with our sponsor on possible locations to pull the actual weather data from.
