# Novemberfest Feedback

- Demonstrate Hurricane Sandy example in poster and in pitch to show how improvements can be made 
- Use an example of an unsuccessful prediction to convince others why this product is needed 
- Show how people can learn from their forecasting mistakes
- Look up visual analytics and disaster relief for references
- Create backup plan of acquiring data in case Aerospace doesn’t pull through
- Say we’re using public data instead of Aerospace data
- Show your own demo of data incase we don’t find real data
- Eventually look at data that is not meteorological
	= ex: Tweets, where airplanes are, location of original Facebook message to where it went
- Explain that this project is directed more towards the model makers
	= It’s the modelers that are the decision makers, so this tool can improve their models
