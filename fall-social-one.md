# Team Social
For our team social we visited the Aerospace Corporation in El Segundo.
One of our members however had a family emergency and could not make it to 
this event. At Aerospace, we toured the "campus," discussed our project,
and ate with out sponsor and his boss. 

Unfortunately we were not allowed pictures inside Aerospace but we provided
a picture of us eating together from another social.
