## What we are building
We are building a custom data visualization off of the open sourced software, nullschool. Our visualization will compare real-time and forecasted data in two separate layers, in addition to having a third layer to show a direct comparison between the two. The data will either be pulled from online sources, or provided by our sponsor at the Aerospace Corporation.

## Why we are building it
We are building the custom data visualization for our sponsor since nothing currently exists in that area at this time. Our sponsor hopes to use it for military and governmental purposes in order to more quickly determine how realistic weather models are.
